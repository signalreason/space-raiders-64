# space-raiders-64
*nostalgia generated by gpt-5.2*

This is a nostalgia piece. Not the original code, not meant to be. I asked for a Space-Invaders-style BASIC listing like the one I typed into my first Commodore 64 in 1984, and this is what the model generated.

It’s untested. It probably has bugs. That’s fine — half the point of those old listings was fixing the typos and making it run.

I’m putting it here because it jogs the memory: line numbers, POKEs everywhere, PETSCII characters, and the pain of debugging a missing quote at line 430.

Nothing more to it. Just a snapshot of what those early programs felt like.
