# space-raiders-64

This was the first code I ever wrote. Actually that's not exactly true. The first code I ever wrote was a BASIC program very much like the one here, copied from the back of the Commodore 64 user guide. *This* code was generated, but it does take me back.

Since you're here, you might find this [collection of BASIC programs](https://github.com/robfromoz/C64-BASIC) interesting.
